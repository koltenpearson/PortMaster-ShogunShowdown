# Portmaster - Shogun Showdown

A script to use box64 to wrap the linux version of Shogun Showdown. Tested on
Retroid Pocket 5 with Rocknix linux

## Installation

Copy the `shogun-showdown` folder and the `shogun-showdown.sh` to be under
`/rom/ports`. Then purchase and install the game on GOG (haven't tested if
Steam works or not), and copy its data (under `game`) to `shogun-showdown/data`

If you want the emulationstation decorations, merge the content of
`gameinfo.xml` into the `gamelist.xml` file
